Lower 48 Tracking Map
==============

This is a basic map and set of JSON files for tracking my family's visitation status of the lower 48. I'm thinking this might be a good template for others to track their visits, thinking if you went to Alaska and Hawaii, you'd remember it.

Several visitation statuses are tracked. These need codes:
1. Not visited
2. Airport touchdown
3. Driven through
4. Overnight Stay
